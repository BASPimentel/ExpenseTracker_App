A simple yet powerful Flutter app for tracking daily expenses with a sleek UI/UX. The app allows users to:

✅ Add expenses with a title and amount
✅ View total expenses for the current month
✅ Delete expenses by long-pressing an entry
✅ Responsive and smooth UI with Material Design
✅ Persistent local storage (coming soon!)

Built with Flutter and Dart, this project is great for learning state management and UI design principles.
